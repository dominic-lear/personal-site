{{/content}}

{{#content "ducks"}}
Ducks have three eyelids!
Ducks normally migrate between 200 and 4,000 feet in the air, but are capable of reaching far greater heights. A jet plane over Nevada once struck a Mallard at an altitude of 21,000 feet! This is currently the highest recorded flight of any duck!
There are around 40 breeds of domestic ducks, with the most popular being the White Pekin.
A Red-Breasted Merganser was once recorded flying at just over 100 miles per hour, whilst being pursued by a plane.
It is a myth that a duck's quack won't echo.
